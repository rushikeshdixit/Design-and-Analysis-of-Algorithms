# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Implementation of Algorithms are as follows:
1. Worst Case Linear Time (via Median of Medians)
2. Expected Linear Time to find Kth Selection
3. Heap Sort
4. Quick Sort
- First element as the pivot
- Random element as pivot
- Median of 3 Heuristic (where 3 numbers are picked randomly and median of those is selected)
