# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
Implemention of Algorithms are as follows:
1. Worst Case Linear Time (via Median of Medians)
2. Expected Linear Time to find Kth Selection
3. Heap Sort
4. Quick Sort
   a. First element as the pivot
   b. Random element as pivot
   c. Median of 3 Heuristic (where 3 numbers are picked randomly and median of those is selected)
